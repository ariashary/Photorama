# Photorama
An iOS photo collection app that shows photos by fetching most recent pictures from FlickrAPI.

The objective to build this app is to get acquainted with the implementation of web service requests in order to get images and metadata from recent photos, and display them to the user.

## Fetaures
* JSON is parsed with NSJSONSerialization, and photos are fetched asynchronously
* Photos are displayed using custom collection view cells and users can create and tag photos, which persist using Core Data
